# FIXME
# Features for optional deps, because the implicit features defined by deps do not scale well.
# For now, THESE are what you should toggle in dependent crates.
#
# Once namespaced-features are stabilized, these features will be renamed after the deps.
# see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1286 (problem and proposal)
#     https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5565 (tracking issue, of sorts)
