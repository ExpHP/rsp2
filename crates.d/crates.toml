# Master config file for crates in this workspace.
#
# This is a homegrown solution (I'm sorry) to a number of
# annoying problems with using workspaces. Cargo.toml files
# in this workspace are generated from source files that
# contain lines like this:
#
#     !!rsp2-assert-close
#     !!itertools
#
# When you run the following command in the workspace root:
#
#     ./crates gen
#
# Cargo.toml files are created with those lines expanded to e.g.
#
#     rsp2-assert-close = { path = "../../util/assert-close" }
#     itertools = "0.7"
#
# based on metadata in this file.

#--------------------------------------------
# Which crate represents the workspace?
root = "rsp2"

#--------------------------------------------
# Specification of all crates in the workspace and their
# paths relative to the root. The 'crates' script uses this
# information to generate the necessary relative paths
# to include when one crate in the workspace depends on
# another.
